== Day 23: Category Six

== Star 1
since I started in VBA i wanted to reuse my intcode. 
This ended up in 2 hours coping fifty times my code and adapt each part to specific variables. 
Finally it worked, but it takes about 30 minutes to reach adress 255. 
Which means, if for part 2 there are more then a few iterations, i have to reprogram :-(
